Sega, on the other hand, was just a faltering arcade company with big aspirations and even bigger personalities. But all that would change with the arrival of Tom Kalinske, a former Mattel executive who knew nothing about videogames and everything about fighting uphill battles. His unconventional tactics, combined with the blood, sweat, and bold ideas of his renegade employees, completely transformed Sega and led to a ruthless, David-and-Goliath showdown with Nintendo. Little did he realize that Sega's success would create many new enemies and, most important, make Nintendo stronger than ever.The battle was vicious, relentless, and highly profitable, eventually sparking a global corporate war that would be fought on several fronts: from living rooms and school yards to boardrooms and Congress. It was a once-in-a-lifetime, no-holds-barred conflict that pitted brother against brother, kid against adult, Sonic against Mario, and the United States against Japan.Based on more than two hundred interviews with former Sega and Nintendo employees, Console Wars is the tale of how Tom Kalinske miraculously turned an industry punch line into a market leader. Blake J. Harris brings into focus the warriors, the strategies, and the battles and explores how they transformed popular culture forever. Ultimately, Console Wars is the story of how a humble family man, with an extraordinary imagination and a gift for turning problems into competitive advantages, inspired a team of underdogs to slay a giant and, as a result, give birth to a sixty-billion-dollar industry"-- "In the tradition of The Accidental Billionaires and Moneyball, a behind-the-scenes business thriller about how the small, scrappy Sega, led by one unlikely visionary, took on the juggernaut Nintendo and changed the face of entertainment"--},

Here are some of the features of Jupyter Book: ✔ Write publication-quality content in Markdown. You can write in either Jupyter Markdown, or an extended flavor of Markdown with publishing features. This includes support for rich syntax such as citations and cross-references, math and equations, and figures. ✔ Write content in Jupyter Notebook. This allows you to include your code and outputs in your book. You can also write notebooks entirely in Markdown that get executed when you build your book. ✔ Execute and cache your book’s content. For {\textless}code{\textgreater}.ipynb{\textless}/code{\textgreater} and Markdown notebooks, execute code and insert the latest outputs into your book. In addition, cache and re-use outputs to be used later. ✔ Insert notebook outputs into your content. Generate outputs as you build your documentation, and insert them in-line with your content across pages. ✔ Add interactivity to your book. You can toggle cell visibility, include interactive outputs from Jupyter, and connect with online services like Binder. ✔ Generate a variety of outputs. This includes single- and multi-page websites, as well as PDF outputs. ✔ Build books with a simple command-line interface. You can quickly generate your books with one command, like so: {\textless}code{\textgreater}jupyter-book build mybook/{\textless}/code{\textgreater}},

20GB hard drive and these bundled extras: Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, an Xbox 360 Media Remote control, an Xbox 360
Headset, a Component HD-AV Cable for connecting to component and composite television inputs, an Ethernet cable, and
batteries. Let the speculation… end.

	abstract = {And now the end is near, and so the PlayStation Portable faces the final curtain. The Sony handheld says sayonara to Japan later this month, when shipments to the country's stores will officially end. 

Sony announced the news today, noting it discontinued North American shipments back in January. The company told Associated Press the PSP is to continue in Europe until later this year, while The Verge adds there are no discontinuation plans yet for lines in Latin America and other Asian countries. 

The PSP's farewell to its homeland comes nine and a half years after it launched there on December 12, 2004. While history will remember it as second-best to the uber-popular DS, the Sony handheld's numbers ain't to be sniffed at. As of March 2012 it had shipped 76.3 million units worldwide, a figure that's probably closer to 80 million now if not beyond. The PSP also brought us the sheer joy of Patapon as well as the resultant joy of Pata-puns, and for that alone it'll always pata-pata-pata-pon in our hearts.

	url = {https://www.engadget.com/2009-08-18-sony-debuts-slimmer-ps3.html},
	abstract = {Hardly a surprise, but Sony got on stage today at GamesCom and confirmed what we've all known deep down in our hearts: the new, slimmer PS3 is really real. It'll be out in the first week of September (September 1 in North America and Europe, September 3 for Japan), and will retail for \$300 (or 300 Euro, or 29,980 Yen). It's smaller and lighter, has a 120GB HDD, and packs "all the same features" of the regular PS3 while consuming 34 percent less power and taking up 32 percent less space. Existing PS3 SKUs have their prices dropped a hundie apiece tomorrow in anticipation, so be sure to grab a space heater while you've still got a shot -- though we're not sure why you'd pay \$300 for an 80GB PS3 when you can wait a couple weeks and get 120GB in a cuter package. A couple pics of the unveil are after the break.

The new 3.0 firmware will be released concurrently with the PS3 slim, which should provide a breath of fresh air for existing machines. Other new features of the PS3 slim include BRAVIA Sync, which allows you to control the PS3 XMB over HDMI through your BRAVIA TV remote, and System Standby to shut off the PS3 when the BRAVIA TV is off. Sony also claims this new machine will run more quietly than existing PS3 systems, which is good news for people who like to watch movies or have conversations in the general vicinity of their game console. There's also a Vertical Stand, which will retail for \$24. Not so awesome is Sony's removal of the Install Other OS feature... farewell, Linux. We hardly knew thee.

Update: We've got press shots! Check 'em all in the gallery below, and be sure to pore over that to-scale comparo pic up top. There's one from above as well, which reveals that the new model is actual "deeper" than the PS3 fat.

Update 2: Video! Our main man Jack Tretton talks up and shows off his spanking new slim PS3 after the break. We've also got a full rundown of the specs for your perusal, and added some new information above.},

We've reached out to the company to learn what this means for the ultimate fate of the PSTV in the US and elsewhere, but it's not looking good when Sony itself isn't making Vita titles.},

	abstract = {There isn't much we don't know about the PlayStation 4 at this point. Sony has let the details slip out in drips and drabs, dragging out the mystery as long as possible. But now, the last remaining blank spot in our dossier -- the release date -- has been filled. At today's Gamescom 2013 press event, the electronics giant revealed that the PS4 will hit shelves on November 15th in the US. On that day you'll be able to run out and grab one for \$399 and immediately start waving your yellow tentacles in Octodad or slaughter rooms full of people in Hotline Miami. Europe will follow shortly afterwards (with a €399 or £349 price point) on November 29th. In total Sony expects to launch the PS4 in 32 countries before the end of the holiday season. That's pretty ambitious, but with 1,000,000 preorders already in the bank, we'd say the company has plenty of reason to be optimistic. Microsoft is already losing the pricing war... now we just have to wait and see if it can get the Xbox One out the door before Sony gets a head start with early adopters.

Update: Our colleagues over at Engadget Spanish have found that Latin America will see the console on November 29th as well.

Update 2: If you're looking for a few more details about where exactly the PS4 will be launching, Sony has announced that the next-gen console will debut in Canada on November 15th alongside the US. On the 29th, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama and Peru will join the party. We've added the complete PR after the break.},
