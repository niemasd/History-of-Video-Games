Thank you for reading *How to Teach Online*!
Whether you are a seasoned instructor or new to teaching,
we hope you will learn some useful information that you will be able to incorporate into your classes!
This resource will be broken down into individual sections focused on specific aspects of online teaching.
We will try to provide multiple examples for each topic,
and we will try to comment on feasibility and usefulness in the context of different disciplines,
as some techniques and tools may lend themselves better to some types of courses than to others.
