Sega, on the other hand, was just a faltering arcade company with big aspirations and even bigger personalities. But all that would change with the arrival of Tom Kalinske, a former Mattel executive who knew nothing about videogames and everything about fighting uphill battles. His unconventional tactics, combined with the blood, sweat, and bold ideas of his renegade employees, completely transformed Sega and led to a ruthless, David-and-Goliath showdown with Nintendo. Little did he realize that Sega's success would create many new enemies and, most important, make Nintendo stronger than ever.The battle was vicious, relentless, and highly profitable, eventually sparking a global corporate war that would be fought on several fronts: from living rooms and school yards to boardrooms and Congress. It was a once-in-a-lifetime, no-holds-barred conflict that pitted brother against brother, kid against adult, Sonic against Mario, and the United States against Japan.Based on more than two hundred interviews with former Sega and Nintendo employees, Console Wars is the tale of how Tom Kalinske miraculously turned an industry punch line into a market leader. Blake J. Harris brings into focus the warriors, the strategies, and the battles and explores how they transformed popular culture forever. Ultimately, Console Wars is the story of how a humble family man, with an extraordinary imagination and a gift for turning problems into competitive advantages, inspired a team of underdogs to slay a giant and, as a result, give birth to a sixty-billion-dollar industry"-- "In the tradition of The Accidental Billionaires and Moneyball, a behind-the-scenes business thriller about how the small, scrappy Sega, led by one unlikely visionary, took on the juggernaut Nintendo and changed the face of entertainment"--},

Here are some of the features of Jupyter Book: ✔ Write publication-quality content in Markdown. You can write in either Jupyter Markdown, or an extended flavor of Markdown with publishing features. This includes support for rich syntax such as citations and cross-references, math and equations, and figures. ✔ Write content in Jupyter Notebook. This allows you to include your code and outputs in your book. You can also write notebooks entirely in Markdown that get executed when you build your book. ✔ Execute and cache your book’s content. For {\textless}code{\textgreater}.ipynb{\textless}/code{\textgreater} and Markdown notebooks, execute code and insert the latest outputs into your book. In addition, cache and re-use outputs to be used later. ✔ Insert notebook outputs into your content. Generate outputs as you build your documentation, and insert them in-line with your content across pages. ✔ Add interactivity to your book. You can toggle cell visibility, include interactive outputs from Jupyter, and connect with online services like Binder. ✔ Generate a variety of outputs. This includes single- and multi-page websites, as well as PDF outputs. ✔ Build books with a simple command-line interface. You can quickly generate your books with one command, like so: {\textless}code{\textgreater}jupyter-book build mybook/{\textless}/code{\textgreater}},

December 10 in Japan for the hat trick release of the

20GB hard drive and these bundled extras: Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, an Xbox 360 Media Remote control, an Xbox 360
Headset, a Component HD-AV Cable for connecting to component and composite television inputs, an Ethernet cable, and
batteries. Let the speculation… end.
