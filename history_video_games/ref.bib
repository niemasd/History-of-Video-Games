	abstract = {{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Jupyter Book{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material. Here are some of the features of Jupyter Book: ✔ Write publication-quality content in Markdown. You can write in either Jupyter Markdown, or an extended flavor of Markdown with publishing features. This includes support for rich syntax such as citations and cross-references, math and equations, and figures. ✔ Write content in Jupyter Notebook. This allows you to include your code and outputs in your book. You can also write notebooks entirely in Markdown that get executed when you build your book. ✔ Execute and cache your book’s content. For {\textless}code{\textgreater}.ipynb{\textless}/code{\textgreater} and Markdown notebooks, execute code and insert the latest outputs into your book. In addition, cache and re-use outputs to be used later. ✔ Insert notebook outputs into your content. Generate outputs as you build your documentation, and insert them in-line with your content across pages. ✔ Add interactivity to your book. You can toggle cell visibility, include interactive outputs from Jupyter, and connect with online services like Binder. ✔ Generate a variety of outputs. This includes single- and multi-page websites, as well as PDF outputs. ✔ Build books with a simple command-line interface. You can quickly generate your books with one command, like so: {\textless}code{\textgreater}jupyter-book build mybook/{\textless}/code{\textgreater}},
